## Some of My Projects

- ### Meteo-Melodies
  About:  This app was the first group project in my coding camp at Georgia Tech.  Along with three others, we created a frontend application that queries Spotify playlists based on the weather of your location.  The OpenWeather API and the Spotify API were used.  This app exemplifies usage of third-party APIs using Fetch.
